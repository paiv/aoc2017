--- Day 25: The Halting Problem ---
--- Part Two ---

The Turing machine, and soon the entire computer, springs back to life. A
console glows dimly nearby, awaiting your command.

> reboot printer
Error: That command requires priority 50. You currently have priority 0.
You must deposit 50 stars to increase your priority to the required level.
The console flickers for a moment, and then prints another message:

Star accepted.
You must deposit 49 stars to increase your priority to the required level.
The garbage collector winks at you, then continues sweeping.


You deposit all fifty stars and reboot the printer. Suddenly, everything seems a
lot less pixelated than before.

"--raise your priority level enough to send the reboot command and... hey look,
it's printing! I'll bring it to Santa. Thanks!" She runs off.
